# Django + React + Tailwind Sample

This is a minimal example of a Django backend (with Django REST framework) and a React frontend with Tailwind CSS.  

## Quick Start

1. **Install Docker and docker-compose** if not already installed.
2. Run `docker-compose up --build` from the project root.
3. Access the React frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
4. The Django API is exposed at [http://localhost:8000/api/todos/](http://localhost:8000/api/todos/).

Happy hacking!

Notes or Issues:

sudo apt install libpq-dev

In the backend folder

django-admin startproject testproject .

python manage.py startapp api

manage.py is used as a CLI utility here

In short: manage.py is the entry point for all the typical day-to-day operations and utility commands for a Django project.

✅ Server Status Tracking
✅ CPU & Memory Monitoring
✅ REST API for Automation
✅ Live Infrastructure Data Visualization
✅ Django Admin Panel for Control
✅ React Frontend for UI

Create model and then perform

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
